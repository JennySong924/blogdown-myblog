背景简介：      

哈瑞、吉米、特伦特三人在全校人面前捉弄了校长Trask，目击者只有Simms（西门斯）和乔治。校长用西门的未来威胁西门说出始作俑者，然而西门并不愿意为了自己的未来就出卖同学。乔治的爸爸很富有，乔治在这个十字路口躲到了他爸爸羽翼的保护下，并出卖了朋友。然而校长却把责任全部推到不听他的话的西门身上，饶过其他人而只开除西门。就在这个时候，西门在感恩节照顾的退休军人Frank看不过去了，做出了下面的精彩演讲：

 
Trask: Mr. Simms, you are a cover-up artist and you are a liar.

西门斯先生，你是一个狡猾的包庇者，是一个说谎者。

Frank: But not a snitch! 

却不是告密者

Trask: Excuse me?

请原谅，再说一遍。

Frank: No, I don't think I will.

我不会原谅你

Trask: Mr. Slade

斯莱德先生

Frank: This is such a crock of shit!

这纯粹是一堆狗屁话。

Trask: Please watch your language, Mr. Slade; you are in the Baird School, not a barracks. Mr. Simms, I'll give you one final opportunity to speak up.

请注意你的语言斯莱德先生，这里是拜尔德中学不是军营。西门斯先生我给你最后一次机会申辩。

Frank: Mr. Simms doesn't want it. He doesn't need to be labeled, still worthy of being a Baird man! What the hell is that? What is your motto here? Boys, inform on your classmates, save your hide, anything short of that, we're gonna burn you at the stake? Well, gentleman, when the shit hits the fan some guys run and some guys stay, here's Charlie, facing the fire and there's George hiding in big daddy's pocket. And what are you doing? And you are gonna reward George, and destroy Charlie.

西门斯先生不需要申辩，他不需要被贴上无愧于拜尔德人的标签。这到底是什么？你们的校训是什么？孩子们，给你们的同学打小报告，要是隐瞒不能撒底的交待，就把你放在火上烤。看吧！子弹扫来的时候，有些人跑了，有些人毅力不动。这位查理迎上去面对火刑，而乔治躲到他老爸的卵翼之下去了，你要怎么做，奖赏乔治，还是毁掉查理。

Trask: Are you finished, Mr. Slade?

你讲完了没有斯莱德中校。

Frank: No, I'm just getting warmed up! I don't know who went to this place, William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryant, William Tell, whoever, their spirit is dead, if they ever had one. It's gone. You're building a rat ship here, a vessel for seagoing snitches. And if you think you're preparing these minnows for manhood, you better think again, because I say you're killing the very spirit this institution proclaims it instills. What a shame! What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? I mean, the only class in this act is sitting next to me, I'm here to tell you this boy's soul is intact, it's non-negotiable, you know how I know, someone here, and I'm not gonna say who, offered to buy it, only Charlie here wasn't selling.

不~~~我才刚刚开了个头，我不知道那些有名的校友是谁—威廉?霍华德塔夫、威廉?詹尼斯?布莱克、威廉?蒂尔，管他呢；他们的精神已经死了，就算有也不在了。你眼下正在打造用来运送告密者的远洋轮，要是你以为正在把他们培养成男子汉，那么你想错了，因为你杀死了恰恰是这种精神，也就这学校所声称的立校精神~多么可耻，你们今天上演的到底是一出什么样的闹剧，在这件事情当中唯一值得夸奖的人就坐在我身边，让我告诉你们这个孩子的品行无可挑剔，这是毋庸置疑，以为我不知道，这里有人~我不说是谁，想收买他。查理不会出卖自己的灵魂

Frank: I'll show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask, I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too fuck in' blind, if I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flame thrower to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talkin' to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see, and I have seen, boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off, but there is nothin' like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that, you think you're merely sendin' this splendid foot solider back home to Oregen with his tail between his legs, but I say you're executin' his soul! And why? Because he is not a Baird man. Baird men, you hurt this boy, you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of you. And Harry, Jimmy, and Trent, wherever you are out there, fuck you too!

斯莱德中校：我告诉你什么叫过份! 你根本不知道什么叫过份!我想示范，但我太老太累又他妈的瞎了 如果是在五年前，我会带喷火枪来这儿！过份？你以为你在跟谁说话？我是见过世面的，明白吗？有一度，我还看得见… 我见过很多很多更年轻的男孩 臂膀被扭，腿被炸断，但那些都不及丑陋的灵魂可怕！灵魂不可能有义肢！你以为你只是把这好青年，像落荒狗似的送回家？我说你是处死了他的灵魂！为什么？因为他不是博德人！博德人！ 伤了这男孩你就是博德孬种！你们全是！而哈瑞、吉米、特伦特，不管你们坐在哪里……去你妈的！

Trask: Stand down, Mr. Slade!

校长：请你肃静，斯莱德中校。

Frank: I'm not finished. As I came in here, I heard those words: cradle of leadership. Well, when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and it has fallen here, it has fallen. Makers of men, creators of leaders, be careful what kind of leaders you're producin' here. I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong, I'm not a judge or jury, but I can tell you this: he won't sell anybody out to buy his future! And that my friends is called integrity, that's called courage. Now, that's the stuff leaders should be made of. Now I have come to crossroads in my life, I always knew what the right path was. Without exception, I knew, but I never took it, you know why, it was too damn hard. Now here's Charlie, he's come to the crossroads, he has chosen a path. It's the right path, it's a path made of principle that leads to character. Let him continue on his journey. You hold this boy's future in your hands, committee, it's a valuable future, believe me. Don't destroy it, protect it. Embrace it. It's gonna make you proud one day, I promise you.

斯莱德中校：我还没讲完！来这儿的时候，我听到类似“领袖摇篮”的字眼。嗯，支干断掉时，摇篮就垮了，它已经在这里垮掉了，已经垮了。人类制造者，领袖创造家，当心你创造的是哪种领袖。我不知道查理今天的缄默是对是错，我不是法官或者陪审团，但我可以告诉你：他绝不会出卖别人以求前程！ 而这，朋友们，就叫正直！ 这就叫勇气！ 那才是领袖的要件。如今我走到人生十字路口，我知道哪条路是对的。毫无例外，我就知道，但我从不走，为什么？ 因为妈的太苦了。而现在查理，他也走到了十字路口，他选择了一条路 这是一条正确的路，充满原则，通往个性之道。让他继续他的行程吧。他的前途掌握在您手中，诸公，绝对是有价值的前途，相信我。别毁了它，保护它。拥抱它。有一天您会自傲，我保证。
